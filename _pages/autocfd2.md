<h3>Summary</h3>

The 2nd Automotive CFD Prediction Workshop was held on the 26th-27th August 2021 in a hybrid format - virtually and in Berlin, Germany. It was preceded by the Fourth International Conference in Numerical and Experimental Aerodynamics of Road Vehicles and Trains (AEROVEHICLES 4 ), and both the conference and workshop were held during the same week. Two test-cases were studied; Windsor body and the DrivAer Notchback (detailed underbody with no rolling road or rotating wheels). Meshes were created for all cases in major grid formats i.e OpenFOAM, STAR-CCM+, Fluent, CGNS in addition to geometry and surface meshes. Participants who submitted results were allocated a 15 minute presentation slot however those who wished to present relevant material (i.e wind-tunnel campaign of the DrivAer model) without computing the test-cases were allowed to speak.
