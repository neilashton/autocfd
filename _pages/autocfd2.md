<h3>Summary</h3>
The 1st Automotive CFD Prediction Workshop was held on the 11-12th December 2019 in Oxford at St Anne's College. Three test-cases were studied; SAE Notchback geometry, DrivAer Fastback and DrivAer Estate vehicle which are described below Meshes were created for all cases in major grid formats i.e OpenFOAM, STAR-CCM+, Fluent, CGNS in addition to geometry and surface meshes. Participants who submitted results were allocated a 15 minute presentation slot however those who wished to present relevant material (i.e wind-tunnel campaign of the DrivAer model) without computing the test-cases were allowed to speak.
Three test-cases were available for participants to compute and submit to the workshop organisors to crossplot and summarize. Each participant who computes these cases will be given a 15 minute presentation slot to discuss their results. Full descriptions of these cases; SAE Notchback (Case 1 ), DrivAer Fastback (Case 2a ) and DrivAer Estate (Case 2b ) are available in prior links with geometry, surface meshes and volume meshes available to download the table below. Meshes in all the major mesh formats i.e OpenFOAM, STAR-CCM+, Fluent, CGNS. Participants were encouraged to run the coarse, medium and fine meshes to demonstrate mesh convergence where possible.
