<b>Deadline for abstract*</b> : 1st June 2024 (updated date) \

<br/><br/>

Due to the large number of registered contributors and the limited number of speaking slots during the two days, all participants who are submitting results will also be asked to submit a 250 word abstract (word or PDF) describing their preliminary findings and methodology ([template](https://autocfd4.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/autocfd4-abstract-template.docx)). This will go through a light peer-review by the organising committee to select speaking slots. 
For those who are not selected to speak, there will be an opportunity to record a video that will be made available on the workshop website.
Please submit these abstracts to the TFG leads:
