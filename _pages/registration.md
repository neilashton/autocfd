<h3>Visa Details</h3>
All attendees at your event must ensure that they have obtained any visa that may be required to visit the United Kingdom before travelling.  It is strongly recommended that those attending events at Queen’s University travel to a UK port of entry.  If they intend to visit the Republic of Ireland during their stay or to transit through the Republic of Ireland en route to Belfast, they may require two visas, one for the United Kingdom and one for the Republic of Ireland.
Up-to-date information on visa requirements can be found on the website of the UK Visas and Immigration.  Details on visa requirements for Ireland can be found at the website of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service.  Attendees can also seek further information from their local British/Irish Embassy or Consulate.
Delegates from some countries may require a visa supporting letter from the conference organiser.  Where this is the case, you should ask them to email their request, stating their full name (as on their passport), address, country, passport number, nationality, travel dates and the date of the visa application to allow you to consider their request.  Visa supporting letters should only be sent to delegates after payment of the necessary conference registration fee.
