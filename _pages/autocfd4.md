<h3>Summary</h3>
Following the success of the previous three workshops (Oxford, 2019, Berlin, 2021 and Barcelona, 2022), we’re proud to announce that the 4th Automotive CFD Prediction Workshop (AutoCFD 4) will be held in 2024, in person, on Sept 26th/27th at Queen's University Belfast.


The main objective of the 4th Automotive CFD Prediction Workshop is to assess the predictive capability of CFD codes for road-cars geometries. Through mandatory geometry, boundary conditions and computational grids the aim is to provide practical modelling guidelines to the automotive community e.g best-practice turbulence modelling, meshing, numerical schemes. In addition we want to bring the automotive CFD community (both academia and industry) together to discuss future directions. The test-cases for the 4th workshop remain the same as per the 3rd workshop to enable participants to continue their research and progress on the existing cases that still have many unresolved challenges.

Computing the test-cases is not required to attend the workshop but we strongly encourage everyone to consider submitting results.

<h3>Technology Focus Groups</h3>

For this workshop we will use a Technology Focus Group (TFG) model (inspired by the 4th AIAA high-lift CFD prediction workshop) where each particpant is requested to join a TFG which covers 5 core areas. These groups will meet every 4-5 weeks and colloboratively share findings and results as we move towards the workshop. The purpose is to encourage deeper discussions over a longer period, compared to only seeing other results and having a discussion during the 2 days of the workshop. The TFG leaders and contacts details are below. Please reach out to them to be included in the monthly meetings.

Our data policy can be found [here](https://autocfdv3.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/data-policy.pdf).

<h3>Dates</h3>
<b>Deadline for abstract*</b> : 14th June 2024 (extended) \
<b>Notice of acceptance</b> : 1st July 2024 (extended) \
<b>Deadline for data submission</b> : 9th August 2024 \
<b>Workshop</b> : September 26th/27th 2024
<br/><br/>

Due to the large number of registered contributors and the limited number of speaking slots during the two days, all participants who are submitting results will also be asked to submit a 250 word abstract (word or PDF) describing their preliminary findings and methodology ([template](https://autocfd4.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/autocfd4-abstract-template.docx)). This will go through a light peer-review by the organising committee to select speaking slots.
For those who are not selected to speak, there will be an opportunity to record a video that will be made available on the workshop website.
Please submit these abstracts to the TFG leads:

<h3>Test-cases</h3>
<h5>Case 1</h5>

<img class="photo" alt="Windsor Body" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/windsor.png">

Case 1 is the Windsor Squareback body at 2.5 degrees yaw and is the same test-case studied in the [3rd automotive CFD workshop](https://autocfd.org/autocfd3). The problem is at a Reynolds number of 3 million based on vehicle length and is within a wind-tunnel like domain. As well as force, moment and surface pressure data, there is also available non intrusive PIV measurements in the wake. The baseline grid is similar to the ‘eddy resolving’ grid from the second workshop and contains 37 million cells. The alternate grids halve and double the core cell size to give 7 million and 197 million cell grids. The grid type follows the second workshop using the ‘trimmer mesh’ and prism layer approach from Simcenter STAR-CCM+.

<h5>Case 2</h5>

Case 2 is the notchback version of the DrivAer and is the same as used in the 3rd automotive CFD prediction workshop. This includes the base variant of the DrivAer (Case 2a) which has been analyzed in the 2nd and 3rd Automotive CFD Prediction Workshops a variant of the DrivAer (Case 2b), which features a front wheel air deflector, and was studied for the 3rd workshop. A detailed description of both DrivAer test cases is available here and, for the base variant, from the SAE Technical Paper 2021-01-0958 by Hupertz et al.. For both DrivAer variants the workshop will focus on a closed cooling configuration with static wheels and static floor. A comprehensive set of experimental data from the Pininfarina Wind Tunnel (Courtesy of Ford) including aerodynamic forces, surface pressure, velocity profiles and 2D flowfield measurements will be available for both DrivAer variants for the correlation of CFD analyses presented at the workshop. Please see below for the meshes which were created using ANSA by BETA-CAE Systems. The mesh of the base variant (Case 2a) is identical to the “Case 2 – Wall-Function Grid” used in the 2nd workshop. The Case 2b mesh is identical to the Case 2a mesh except for the front wheel air deflector region.
