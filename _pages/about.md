Following the success of the previous three workshops (Oxford, 2019, Berlin, 2021 and Barcelona, 2022), weâ€™re proud to announce that the 4th Automotive CFD Prediction Workshop (AutoCFD 4) will be held in 2024, in person, on Sept 26th/27th at Queen's University Belfast.


The main objective of the 4th Automotive CFD Prediction Workshop is to assess the predictive capability of CFD codes for road-cars geometries. Through mandatory geometry, boundary conditions and computational grids the aim is to provide practical modelling guidelines to the automotive community e.g best-practice turbulence modelling, meshing, numerical schemes. In addition we want to bring the automotive CFD community (both academia and industry) together to discuss future directions. The test-cases for the 4th workshop remain the same as per the 3rd workshop to enable participants to continue their research and progress on the existing cases that still have many unresolved challenges.
