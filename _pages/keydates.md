<b>Deadline for abstract*</b> : 1st May 2024 \
<b>Notice of acceptance</b> : 31st May 2024 \
<b>Deadline for data submission</b> : 9th August 2024 \
<b>Workshop</b> : September 26th/27th 2024 
<br/><br/>

* Due to the large number of registered contributors and the limited number of speaking slots during the two days, all participants who are submitting results will also be asked to submit a 250 word abstract (word or PDF) describing their main findings and methodology ([template](https://autocfdv3.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/abstract-template.docx)). This will go through a light peer-review by the organising committee to select speaking slots. For those who are not selected to speak, there will be an opportunity to record a video that will be made available on the workshop website for all participants to watch during the workshop. Any questions, please contact [admin@autocfd.org](admin@autocfd.org)
